        <h1>20 Bollywood Movies One Must Watch</h1>
        <p>Bollywood- by this name the only thing that comes to our mind is full on
            Drama, Action, Comedy, Romance, Climax and much more.Ever since our childhood we have been a great fan of
            bollywood movies.Some of them inspire us,some make us cry,some make us laugh and some even make us think
            that do these things happen in real life? aaa.. one second may be not. Well there are some movies which
            we cannot eraze out of our mind -like<em><b>Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham</b></em>-reminds me Kajol and
            Gamla scene "<em><b>Jab We Met</b></em>forget Karena saying " mein apni favourite hu",<em><b>Dil toh paagal
                    hai</b></em>-movie which gave us the most popular dialogue "Rahul naam to sunahi hoga"
            and much more. Here are some movies that you must watch once in your life - may be more than once.

        <p>

        <br>
        <p>Life - don't you think we have made it more complicated on the way of doing our jobs and making our
            carrier we have stopped enjoying our life.Even the smallest things that use to make us happy no longer
            does that.So this movie tells us to explore the world and to the things that make us happy ,things that
            we fear the most don't keep them for our future coz you never know which is the last day of your life
            .So
            "My Bwoys" and my girls out there who haven't watched this movie do it .We live only once my friend and
            don't forget to
            keep the child in you alive . </p>

        <br>
        <img src="hera.jpg" alt="herapheri" class="image">
        <br>
        <p>
            "Ye Baburao ka style a","Devi Prasad ghar par hain" are my favourite dialogue from this movie. Babu bhai,
            raju and shyam characters from this movies can give you a laughter attack. They will entertain you in the
            movie and I bet you will have blast watching this movie. This is one of the biggest comedy hits in
            bollywood. If you loved this movie and were laughing like crazy then I would recommend you to watch the
            sequel of this movie Phir Hera Pheri and I sure it will not disappoint you.
        </p>

        <h2>#3 Dil Chahta hai</h2>

        <br>
        <p>
            "Dil Chahta hai hum na rahein kabhi yaaro ke bin" - umm... let me guess reading these lines did just thought
            about your friends may be yes rigth. We always love our company of friends but
            after college we all get separated and get busy with our indiviual lives. Very few of them remain in contact
            - by that I don't mean your contact list or your facebook friend I mean to say the contact which you had
            with them in college or school days. This movie has a similar plot Amir, Saif and Akshay has done
            justice with the roles in the movie. So do watch this movie it will remind you your college days and the
            time which you enjoyed the most.

        <h2>#4 3 Idiots</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="3idiots.jpg" alt="3idiots" class="image">
        <br>
        <p>"How does an induction moter starts ?" is my favourite scene from this movie .Rancho, Raju and Farhan from
            their story tells us about our
            eduction system. Movie tell use that life is not a rat race and a compitition. Life is not about doing what
            the most people out
            their are doing you can have a different carrier. Rancho tells us to follow our passion and make it our
            carrier and you will enjoy whatever your doing .As Rancho says
            "Success ke piye mat bhago ,Excellence ke peeche bagho phir dekha Success jhak mar ke tumhare pass ayegi".
            Just follow your heart and see the magic.

            "Woh dinn bhi kya din the" eveytime I listen to this song I miss my friends and I know you same would be
            happening with you. Movie Starring one of the best actors  Sushat Singh Rajput will teach you the best
            lesson of your life "Success Ke Baad Ka Plan Sabke Paas Hai Lekin Agar Galti Se Fail Ho Gaye Toh Failure Se
            Kaise Deal Karna Hai Iski Koi Baat Hi Nahi Karna Chahta." It is a worth watching movie.
